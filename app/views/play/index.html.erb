<h1> The Agile Iterations Game - How to Play </h1> 
<h3> Prerequisites</h3>
<p> To play the iterations game you need 
<ol>
  <li> A team of 4-8 people</li>
  <li> A prioritized stack of story cards</li>
  <li> A agile team wall that looks like the table at the bottom of this page</li>
</ol>
<table class='board'>
  <tr>
    <th> Backlog </th>
    <th> Dev WIP </th>
    <th> Dev Complete </th>
    <th> Testing WIP </th>
    <th> Rejected </th>
    <th> Accepted </th>
  </tr>

<h3> The Objective </h3>
<p> Earn enough work credits in an iteration to finish as many stories as a team as you can.
<h3> The First Turn </h3>
<p> Each player draws a story card from the top of the stack, initials it and puts it in the Dev WIP lane.
<p> Take turns clicking the "Work on a story" link and following the instructions until each player has gone once. 
<p> After each turn, click the day complete link. 
<h3> Rinse and Repeat </h3>
<p> Keep taking turns until the game is over. At the start of each turn, a player can decide to work on a story or test two story cards (if there are any that are in the Dev Complete lane).
<h3> Ending the game </h3>
<p> The game ends after five rounds. Pull all the cards in the accepted lane off the wall and add up your points. This is your velocity.
